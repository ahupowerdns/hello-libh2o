                            **A warm welcome to libh2o**

# Hello, and welcome to libh2o

**NOTE**: This is very early work & may have a lot of mistakes. If you find
any, please let me know at bert.hubert@powerdns.com or
[@PowerDNS_Bert](https://twitter.com/PowerDNS_Bert).

[H2O](https://h2o.examp1e.net/) is a powerful web server used and developed
by Fastly.  Its mission:

> H2O is a new generation HTTP server that provides quicker response to
> users with less CPU utilization when compared to older generation of web
> servers.  Designed from ground-up, the server takes full advantage of
> HTTP/2 features including prioritized content serving and server push,
> promising outstanding experience to the visitors of your web site.

H2O as a web server is very impressive and is seeing more and more use.
H2O is powered by `libh2o`, which contains all the web serving power of H2O
itself. `libh2o` is also packaged separately for third party use. It is MIT
licensed. 

I have used more web server frameworks than is reasonable. `libh2o` is by far
the most impressive effort I have ever seen, possibly because as far as I
know, it is the only web serving library that also powers a leading web
serving project.

The one downside of `libh2o` is that its documentation is currently very
spread out.  Parts live in the
[`h2o.h`](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/include/h2o.h) include
file, other parts can be found in answers in the GitHub issue tracker, in
[issues tagged with 'FAQ'](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/labels/FAQ).  A great
(if slightly outdated) introduction can also be found in [this
presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/kazuho/h2o-20141103pptx).

Here, I hope to provide an introduction to libh2o that is correct,
if not necessarily complete. Over time, the goal is to maintain correctness
while coverage increases.

The H2O maintainers are [incredibly friendly and
helpful](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/1894). With this document
I hope to help them along in improving (lib)h2o.

# Basics
H2O comes with a full & leading implementation of HTTP/2. It strives to make
HTTP/2 as fast as possible, to the point it can be a universal method
of performing calls and transferring data. 

Within H2O, HTTP requests are 'events' within connections. Events end up
with a `handler`, and `handler`s use `generator`s to send content. 

Of specific note, unlike most libraries, `libh2o` can be used fully
asynchronously. This means that your code can receive an HTTP request & go
chew on it. Meanwhile, other HTTP requests come in and also get served. Once
your code is done with the earlier HTTP request, it can send out the
response. 

This is specifically relevant since HTTP/2 is fundamentally asynchronous
too: many requests may come in at the same time over a single connection.
These all need to get serviced in parallel, and not sequentially.

# HTTP/2 notes
By default `libh2o` is protocol agnostic.  Your code does not need to know
if it is dealing with HTTP/1 or HTTP/2, and out of the box both are
available.  The behaviour of how HTTP/1 sessions might be upgraded to HTTP/2
and the interaction with TLS/SSL can of course be tweaked.

Specific HTTP/2 features such as server push are of course only available on
HTTP/2 connections.

# Data types & storage
`libh2o` is written in C. This makes the library very accessible, but also
means that H2O has to create some data structures from scratch. Here are a
few types you will encounter a lot:

 * `H2O_STRLIT`: `h2o` passes strings around as a pointer and a length. This
   saves on repetitive `strlen()` calls and also makes it possible to pass
   arbitrary binary data. To pass a "classical C string",
   `H2O_STRLIT("GET")` is used, which then expands to: 
   `"GET", strlen("GET")`.
 * Strings are then compared using `h2o_memis` which accepts two
   pointer/length pairs. An example: 
   `if(h2o_memis(req->method.base, req->method.len, H2O_STRLIT("GET")))`
 * `h2o_iovec_t`: a structure describing memory as above, a pointer and a
   length field. Created by calling `h2o_iovec_init(ptr, len)`.
 * `h2o_vector_t`: A vector (dynamic array) of items. 
   
Memory allocation is always difficult. To make it easier, `libh2o` offers us
pools associated with HTTP requests and connections. Any data allocated to a
pool will get released automatically when the pool gets disposed.    

# Hello, world

The `libh2o` "Hello World" example server is longer than you may be used to.
This is because h2o is a very powerful library and it needs to be generic
enough to cover a lot of use cases. Some simpler libraries may allow you to
be up and running in 12 lines but leave you hanging if you need to set a
socket option. 

A basic `libh2o` web server takes around 80 lines to deliver a fully
functional web server. What follows is a slightly reordered version of
[simple.c](simple.c) which in turn is a slightly modified version of
[simple.c](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/examples/libh2o/simple.c)
from the `h2o` examples directory.

First the basics:

```
static h2o_globalconf_t config;
static h2o_context_t ctx;
static h2o_accept_ctx_t accept_ctx;
```

These three contain global `h2o` configuration, a `context` for your
web server plus an accept `context` for your listener thread. Note that the
`static` is not accidental: **be sure to zero these structs before using
them**!

Then to get going:

```
h2o_config_init(&config);
h2o_hostconf_t* hostconf = h2o_config_register_host(&config, h2o_iovec_init(H2O_STRLIT("default")), 65535);
```

This initializes the global config to default values and it registers a host
called 'default'. Note that this accepts a `h2o_iovec_t` as described above.
When registering the host we also pass a port, where 65535 means 'the
default port for the protocol used', or in other words '80' or '443'. 

If only one host is registered, all of this is moot, since all queries,
regardless of host name or port, then end up with the first host. 

When registering multiple host names, a single registration is enough when
using standard ports (80, 443). If non-standard ports are used, you must
register a name twice, once for each port (say, 8000, 4430). 

Next up we register a `path` for "/hello". We then create a handler for this
path, and we add a function `helloHandler` to it:

```
h2o_pathconf_t *pathconf = h2o_config_register_path(hostconf, "/hello", 0);
h2o_handler_t *handler = h2o_create_handler(pathconf, sizeof(*handler));
handler->on_req = handler;
```

Note that paths are checked in order. This means that if the "/" path is
registered first, no subsequent paths are ever going to match. So register
paths from most specific to most general.

We then initialize the global `ctx` with the global `config`. 
```
h2o_context_init(&ctx, h2o_evloop_create(), &config);
accept_ctx.ctx = &ctx;
accept_ctx.hosts = config.hosts;
``` 

Next up, listening and setting up the event loop:

```
    struct sockaddr_in addr;
    int fd, reuseaddr_flag = 1;
    h2o_socket_t *sock;

    memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(addr));
    addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(0x7f000001);
    addr.sin_port = htons(12345);

    if ((fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1 ||
        setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &reuseaddr_flag, sizeof(reuseaddr_flag)) != 0 ||
        bind(fd, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr)) != 0 || listen(fd, SOMAXCONN) != 0) {
        return -1;
    }
```

This is the usual longwinded C way of creating a socket, in this case, one
that listens on 127.0.0.1:12345.

```
    sock = h2o_evloop_socket_create(ctx.loop, fd, H2O_SOCKET_FLAG_DONT_READ);
    h2o_socket_read_start(sock, on_accept);
```

This is the `h2o` specific bit, where we add the socket we created to the
event loop, and tell `h2o` not to read from this socket but if it becomes
readable to call our handler `on_accept`. This is what happens there:

```
static void on_accept(h2o_socket_t *listener, const char *err)
{
    h2o_socket_t *sock;

    if (err != NULL) {
        return;
    }

    if ((sock = h2o_evloop_socket_accept(listener)) == NULL)
        return;
    h2o_accept(&accept_ctx, sock);
}
```

This is effectively a filter that calls `accept(2)` on the listener socket
(through h2o_evloop_socket_accept) and then tells `h2o` to accept this new
socket as well.

Once all this is setup we can enter the `h2o` event loop:

```
    while (h2o_evloop_run(ctx.loop, INT32_MAX) == 0)
        ;
```

Here is the `helloHandler` function we hooked above:

```
static int helloHandler(h2o_handler_t* handler, h2o_req_t* req)
{
  if (!h2o_memis(req->method.base, req->method.len, H2O_STRLIT("GET")))
    return -1;
  
  req->res.status = 200;
  req->res.reason = "OK";
  h2o_add_header(&req->pool, &req->res.headers, H2O_TOKEN_CONTENT_TYPE, 
    NULL, H2O_STRLIT("text/plain"));    
  h2o_send_inline(req, H2O_STRLIT("Hello, world\n"));
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note that this uses `h2o_memis` to check it is getting a GET request, and if
it isn't, the handler returns -1 to indicate it did not handle the request.

We then set status, reason, content-type, and use the helper function
`h2o_send_inline` to send a response.

`h2o_send_inline` is a slower convenience function for sending chunks of
memory to a client. Behind this function hide `generators` which are a more
generic and faster way of sending data, without having to supply all data in
one go.

Finally, please note that `libh2o` is event driven. If our `helloHandler`
sleeps for a second, nothing else will happen during that second! Please
read on for how to deal with slow data sources.

# Object lifetime, memory management
As noted, memory management is hard. Within libh2o most management is
automated for you. For example, when you get passed a request (`h2o_req_t`),
it is not your responsibility to free it when you are done. 

And in fact, you can use a request to allocate data associated with that
request, and this will be deallocated if for whatever reason the request is
done or goes away.

As an example, to allocate an stdio FILE pointer:

```
FILE** fpptr = h2o_mem_alloc_shared(req->pool, sizeof(FILE*), on_FILE_close);
*fpptr = fopen("/etc/motd", "r");
// do things with file
```
Note that we also passed a callback `on_FILE_close` and it looks like this:

```
static void on_FILE_close(void *ptr)
{
  FILE** fpptr = (FILE**) ptr;
  if(*fpptr)
    fclose(fpptr);
}
```
When used like this, we can be sure that memory for our file pointer is
cleaned up, AND that the file pointer will get closed when the request is
done or otherwise disposed of. Such automated memory and resource management
is vital when using asynchronous operations.

# Config, context, accept context
In this small sample, we've been passing around an H2O config, a context and
an accept context. 

**NOTE**: This section is quite speculative

## Global configuration
The global configuration actually is not global, as in, it is possible to
run several completely independent h2o instances within a single binary. It
is however also possible to have a single instance that serves on several
listening sockets and also offers multiple servers in there, and these then
share the 'global' configuration.

The global configuration knows specifies things like HTTP/1 or HTTP/2
timeouts, if HTTP/1 connections should attempt an upgrade to HTTP/2, maximum
size of POST data and many other settings. The defaults are good though.

## Accept context
An accept context can be plaintext or a TLS context. One socket can host
multiple sockets, and sockets are registered to a context.

Note that hosts that are registered exist within all contexts, and thus also
on all sockets.

## Context
The context owns the event loop, to which multiple sockets can report, that
in turn can report to different accept contexts. 

It also keeps counters for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections.

# Generators
As noted above, `h2o_send_inline` is a convenience function for sending data
in response to an HTTP request. If we want to send a fixed blob of data we
already have in memory this is fine, but if we for example want to send the
large output of a SQL query, which arrives in separate rows, this is not the
best interface.

The 'long form' of sending data to a request is by setting a `generator`:

```
    static h2o_generator_t generator = {proceedSending, stopSending};
    h2o_start_response(req, &generator);

    h2o_iovec_t buf;
    
    // gather initial data from SQL query, store it in buf
    
    h2o_send(req, &buf, 1, H2O_SEND_STATE_IN_PROGRESS);
```

First we register two callbacks: `proceedSending` and `stopSending`. The
last one is called when the HTTP session went away for any reason, and
offers us the ability to close down the SQL session or perform any other
cleanup.

**Note**: As elsewhere, the `static` is not optional. When we pass a pointer
to the generator, `libh2o` makes no copy for us. Without `static`, our
generator would soon be pointing to dangling memory. There is a reason for
this behaviour which is explained [below](#passingdata).

We then gather some initial data and send that using `h2o_send`. In this
syntax we can pass an array of `h2o_iovec_t` buffers, but here we pass just
1. The final parameter `H2O_SEND_STATE_IN_PROGRESS` means that at a later
stage we might have more data to offer. 

Importantly, while `h2o_send` is working on the data, you must not touch or
free the data you passed to be sent: `libh2o` made no copy for you. This in
contrast to `h2o_send_inline` which as a convenience does so for you.

Once `libh2o` has sent out the initial data, it will call our
`proceedSending` callback to ask for more. That is also the moment we can
free any memory we allocated for `h2o_send`. If in `proceedSending` we find
that we've hit the end of the data we want to serve, we emit a final call to
`h2o_send` with as final parameter `H2O_SEND_STATE_FINAL`. 

We are not guaranteed to get a call to `stopSending`, so any cleanup should
be performed once we pass `H2O_SEND_STATE_FINAL`.

# Serving files
A special case is serving static files from disk. This can of course be
implemented using `h2o_start_response`, but `h2o` has built-in primitives to
make this happen:

```
    h2o_pathconf_t* pathconf = h2o_config_register_path(hostconf, "/", 0);
    h2o_file_register(pathconf, "examples/doc_root", NULL, NULL, 0);
```
The third parameter of `h2o_file_register` specifies an array of files that
could serve the index of that path. The fourth parameter is an optional map
of MIME-types. The final parameter specifies flags [XXX which ones?]

If it is known what files to serve exactly, `h2o_file_register_file` can be
used.

# Passing data to handlers and generators

In general, passing data around in `libh2o` is somewhat cumbersome, but we
hope, at least very efficient.  The general technique is that when we set a
`handler` or a `generator`, we send a pointer to something that starts with
a `h2o_handler_t` or `h2o_generator_t` respectively.  If we have no need to
pass additional data, that is in fact all that will be stored at that
pointer.

But if we want to pass additional data, we do so by creating a larger
struct, that **starts** with a `h2o_handler_t` (for a handler):

```
struct ParameterHandler
{
  h2o_handler_t handler;
  int parameter;
};
// .. set pathconf ..
ParameterHandler *handler = 
  (ParameterHandler*) h2o_create_handler(pathconf, sizeof (*handler));
handler->handler.on_req = ourHandler;
handler->parameter = 42;
```

Within ourHandler we then do the reverse and cast the `h2o_handler_t`
pointer back to a `ParameterHandler` pointer:
```
int ourHandler(h2o_handler_t* handler, h2o_req_t* req)
{
  ParameterHandler* phandler = (ParameterHandler*)handler;
  // phandler->parameter will now be 42
  ...
}
```
## To a generator
When we need to pass data to a generator, we use a very similar technique,
except without `h2o_create_handler`'s help:

```
struct State
{
  h2o_generator_t super;
  int parameter;
};
...

State* state = (State*)h2o_mem_alloc_shared(&req->pool, sizeof(State), on_dispose);
state->super = {proceedSending, stopSending}
state->parameter = 23;

...
void proceedSending(h2o_generator_t *self, h2o_req_t *req)
{
  State* state = (State*)self;
  // state->parameter is now 23
  ...
}
```

Note that we may need to pass an `on_dispose` callback if State had any
buffers in need of freeing (which is very likely for a generator).

# Logging
...

# SSL / TLS
`libh2o` uses OpenSSL or picotls for HTTPS and HTTPS/2. There is significant
interaction between the TLS and HTTP components. When using OpenSSL, we
first need to initialize that library:

**Question**: Is picotls standalone? Or does it get its crypto operations
from OpenSSL?

```
SSL_load_error_strings();
SSL_library_init();
OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
```

In `libh2o`, TLS is specific for an accept context as described above. Here
is how we hook op OpenSSL to the accept context:

```
accept_ctx.ssl_ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_server_method());
accept_ctx.expect_proxy_line = 0; // makes valgrind happy
```

**Please note that the `accept_ctx` struct must be zeroed before use**.

We can then continue to configure OpenSSL with options:
```
SSL_CTX_set_options(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);
SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, 1);

/* load certificate and private key */
if(SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, cert_file) != 1) {
  fprintf(stderr, "an error occurred while trying to load server certificate file:%s\n", cert_file);
  return -1;
}

if(SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, key_file, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) != 1) {
  fprintf(stderr, "an error occurred while trying to load private key file:%s\n", key_file);
  return -1;
}

char ciphers[]="DEFAULT:!MD5:!DSS:!DES:!RC4:!RC2:!SEED:!IDEA:!NULL:!ADH:!EXP:!SRP:!PSK";
if(SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, ciphers) != 1) {
  fprintf(stderr, "ciphers could not be set: %s\n", ciphers);
  return -1;
}
```

Finally, we can hook up HTTP/2 selection to ALPN, which allows a client to
immediately select HTTP/2 through the TLS negotiation:

```
  h2o_ssl_register_alpn_protocols(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, h2o_http2_alpn_protocols);
```

Note: there also is support for another selection protocol called NPN, but
it appears to no longer be used by clients.

# HTTP/2 specific features

**Question**: How much of the pushed data smarts are in libh2o? How many are
in "h2o the server". Is this CASPER?

# Event loops (libuv, native)
**Question**: Is there any benefit to using libuv?  When would you want to
do that?
...

# H2O as a client library
To facilitate proxying, H2O also supports outgoing HTTP connections. As with
the rest of `libh2o`, this is an industrial strength solution so it requires
a bit of work to setup.

`h2o_httpclient_connect` initiates a connection based on a parsed URL.  This
will also (asynchronously) resolve IP addresses for you.  Once the
connection in place, an `on_connect` callback is called.  This has to
perform various mechanics and then returns an `on_head` callback which is
called when the headers have been received from the HTTP server.

`on_head` can then look at the headers and in turn returns the `on_body`
callback. This then gets called whenever a chunk of body is ready for
processing, which can then be found on the `h2o_httpclient_t`* parameter.
The `on_body` callback can tell `libh2o` it has consumed from the buffer
by calling `h2o_buffer_consume`. 

Sample code can be found in
[http1client.c](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/examples/libh2o/http1client.c)
from the `libh2o` examples directory, where you can see the (verbose)
mechanics we skipped over in the preceeding description. 

# H2O multithreading
... 

# Notes on asynchronous operations
Requests can be handled completely within a request handler when data is
immediately available (in memory) to send to the client. Often this will not
be the case. 

`libh2o` offers multiple ways to deal with slow data sources, or with large
chunks of data we do no want to keep in memory for a long time.

## Stop and proceed
As noted above, we can send an initial amount of data with `h2o_send` but
note that this is not yet everything. The `proceed` callback of the
generator will then be called once `h2o` needs more data from us to send to
the client. This callback should then immediately supply that data. For many
data sources this is fast enough - for example, when reading from a file.

## Asynchronous
At other times however we may be serving data sourced from a database or
another service reached over the network in which case blocking on our
`proceed` callback is not feasible.

The good news is that `libh2o` is completely asynchronous itself - it will
not get confused if your handler does not immediately do anything with a
request. 

This means that in the request handler, or in the `proceed` callback, you
can send out a request for more data to your backend, and return control to
the `libh2o` event loop. When you do so however, you must make sure that
event loop picks up when you have new data available!

If you are streaming data from another socket, this is as easy as adding
that socket to the main event loop like this:

```
h2o_sock_t sock = h2o_evloop_socket_create(dsc->h2o_ctx.loop, 
  oursock, H2O_SOCKET_FLAG_DONT_READ);
// a pointer that tells you which request this belongs to  
sock->data = req; 

// this listens to responses from our socket to turn into http data
h2o_socket_read_start(sock, on_oursock);
```

When the `on_oursock` callback gets called, we know it will be able to read
data from `oursock` & pass it on to `h2o_send`, being careful to mark that
as `H2O_SEND_STATE_IN_PROGRESS` unless we got an end-of-data indicator.

**HOWEVER**: while waiting for data from the backend socket, the actual
`libh2o` request may have disappeared! There may have been a network error,
or the client disconnected, or a timeout happened. This will cause big
problems in `on_oursock` which will then attempt to send data to a dead
request. This is not a theoretical problem by the way, it will happen almost
immediately under any kind of load.

There are two ways of detecting that a socket is gone. The first one is to
set the `stop` callback when calling `h2o_start_response`. This will get
called if the request times out. From that callback, it is then possible to
disconnect `oursock` from the event loop or to close it or to otherwise set
a marker that the `on_oursock` callback does not touch the request.

The downside of this method is that in the initial request handler, not
everything may already be known to issue a response.  For example, it is no
longer possible to create a 4xx or 5xx error afterwards. And you may need to
do that based on data you received from `oursock`.

A second way of being informed of a request teardown is by associating some
memory with it using `h2o_mem_alloc_shared` as shown above. If a request
gets disposed, the callback associated with this memory gets called, and it
too can then take measures to prevent `on_oursock` from touching the now
deleted request.

issue](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/1894).
