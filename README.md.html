                            **A warm welcome to libh2o**

# Hello, and welcome to libh2o

**NOTE**: This is very early work & may have a lot of mistakes. If you find
any, please let me know at bert.hubert@powerdns.com or
[@PowerDNS_Bert](https://twitter.com/PowerDNS_Bert).

[H2O](https://h2o.examp1e.net/) is a powerful web server used and developed
by Fastly.  Its mission:

> H2O is a new generation HTTP server that provides quicker response to
> users with less CPU utilization when compared to older generation of web
> servers.  Designed from ground-up, the server takes full advantage of
> HTTP/2 features including prioritized content serving and server push,
> promising outstanding experience to the visitors of your web site.

H2O as a web server is very impressive and is seeing more and more use.
H2O is powered by `libh2o`, which contains all the web serving power of H2O
itself. `libh2o` is also packaged separately for third party use. It is MIT
licensed. 

I have used more web server frameworks than is reasonable. `libh2o` is by far
the most impressive effort I have ever seen, possibly because as far as I
know, it is the only web serving library that also powers a leading web
serving project.

The one downside of `libh2o` is that its documentation is currently very
spread out.  Parts live in the
[`h2o.h`](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/include/h2o.h) include
file, other parts can be found in answers in the GitHub issue tracker, in
[issues tagged with 'FAQ'](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/labels/FAQ).  A great
(if slightly outdated) introduction can also be found in [this
presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/kazuho/h2o-20141103pptx).

Here, I hope to provide an introduction to libh2o that is correct,
if not necessarily complete. Over time, the goal is to maintain correctness
while coverage increases.

The H2O maintainers are [incredibly friendly and
helpful](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/1894). With this document
I hope to help them along in improving (lib)h2o.

# Basics
H2O comes with a full & leading implementation of HTTP/2. It strives to make
HTTP/2 as fast as possible, to the point it can be a universal method
of performing calls and transferring data. 

Within H2O, HTTP requests are 'events' within connections. Events end up
with a `handler`, and `handler`s use `generator`s to send content. 

Of specific note, unlike most libraries, `libh2o` can be used fully
asynchronously. This means that your code can receive an HTTP request & go
chew on it. Meanwhile, other HTTP requests come in and also get served. Once
your code is done with the earlier HTTP request, it can send out the
response. 

This is specifically relevant since HTTP/2 is fundamentally asynchronous
too: many requests may come in at the same time over a single connection.
These all need to get serviced in parallel, and not sequentially.

# HTTP/2 notes
By default `libh2o` is protocol agnostic.  Your code does not need to know
if it is dealing with HTTP/1 or HTTP/2, and out of the box both are
available.  The behaviour of how HTTP/1 sessions might be upgraded to HTTP/2
and the interaction with TLS/SSL can of course be tweaked.

Specific HTTP/2 features such as server push are of course only available on
HTTP/2 connections.

# Data types & storage
`libh2o` is written in C. This makes the library very accessible, but also
means that H2O has to create some data structures from scratch. Here are a
few types you will encounter a lot:

 * `H2O_STRLIT`: `h2o` passes strings around as a pointer and a length. This
   saves on repetitive `strlen()` calls and also makes it possible to pass
   arbitrary binary data. To pass a "classical C string",
   `H2O_STRLIT("GET")` is used, which then expands to: 
   `"GET", strlen("GET")`.
 * Strings are then compared using `h2o_memis` which accepts two
   pointer/length pairs. An example: 
   `if(h2o_memis(req->method.base, req->method.len, H2O_STRLIT("GET")))`
 * `h2o_iovec_t`: a structure describing memory as above, a pointer and a
   length field. Created by calling `h2o_iovec_init(ptr, len)`.
 * `h2o_vector_t`: A vector (dynamic array) of items. 
   
Memory allocation is always difficult. To make it easier, `libh2o` offers us
pools associated with HTTP requests and connections. Any data allocated to a
pool will get released automatically when the pool gets disposed.    

# Hello, world

The `libh2o` "Hello World" example server is longer than you may be used to.
This is because h2o is a very powerful library and it needs to be generic
enough to cover a lot of use cases. Some simpler libraries may allow you to
be up and running in 12 lines but leave you hanging if you need to set a
socket option. 

A basic `libh2o` web server takes around 80 lines to deliver a fully
functional web server. What follows is a slightly reordered version of
[simple.c](simple.c) which in turn is a slightly modified version of
[simple.c](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/blob/master/examples/libh2o/simple.c)
from the `h2o` examples directory.

First the basics:

```
static h2o_globalconf_t config;
static h2o_context_t ctx;
static h2o_accept_ctx_t accept_ctx;
```

These three contain global `h2o` configuration, a `context` for your
web server plus an accept `context` for your listener thread.

Then to get going:

```
h2o_config_init(&config);
h2o_hostconf_t* hostconf = h2o_config_register_host(&config, h2o_iovec_init(H2O_STRLIT("default")), 65535);

h2o_pathconf_t *pathconf = h2o_config_register_path(hostconf, "/hello", 0);
h2o_handler_t *helloHandler = h2o_create_handler(pathconf, sizeof(*handler));
handler->on_req = helloHandler;

h2o_context_init(&ctx, h2o_evloop_create(), &config);

accept_ctx.ctx = &ctx;
accept_ctx.hosts = config.hosts;
``` 

This initializes the global config to default values and it registers a host
called 'default'. Note that this accepts a `h2o_iovec_t` as described above.

Next up we register a `path` for "/hello". We then create a handler for this
path, and we add a function `helloHandler` to it.

We then initialize the global `ctx` with the global `config`. 

Next up, listening and setting up the event loop:

```
    struct sockaddr_in addr;
    int fd, reuseaddr_flag = 1;
    h2o_socket_t *sock;

    memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(addr));
    addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(0x7f000001);
    addr.sin_port = htons(12345);

    if ((fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1 ||
        setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &reuseaddr_flag, sizeof(reuseaddr_flag)) != 0 ||
        bind(fd, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr)) != 0 || listen(fd, SOMAXCONN) != 0) {
        return -1;
    }
```

This is the usual longwinded C way of creating a socket, in this case, one
that listens on 127.0.0.1:12345.

```
    sock = h2o_evloop_socket_create(ctx.loop, fd, H2O_SOCKET_FLAG_DONT_READ);
    h2o_socket_read_start(sock, on_accept);
```

This is the `h2o` specific bit, where we add the socket we created to the
event loop, and tell `h2o` not to read from this socket but if it becomes
readable to call our handler `on_accept`. This is what happens there:

```
static void on_accept(h2o_socket_t *listener, const char *err)
{
    h2o_socket_t *sock;

    if (err != NULL) {
        return;
    }

    if ((sock = h2o_evloop_socket_accept(listener)) == NULL)
        return;
    h2o_accept(&accept_ctx, sock);
}
```

This is effectively a filter that calls `accept(2)` on the listener socket
(through h2o_evloop_socket_accept) and then tells `h2o` to accept this new
socket as well.

Once all this is setup we can enter the `h2o` event loop:

```
    while (h2o_evloop_run(ctx.loop, INT32_MAX) == 0)
        ;
```

Here is the `helloHandler` function we hooked above:

```
static int helloHandler(h2o_handler_t* handler, h2o_req_t* req)
{
  if (!h2o_memis(req->method.base, req->method.len, H2O_STRLIT("GET")))
    return -1;
  
  req->res.status = 200;
  req->res.reason = "OK";
  h2o_add_header(&req->pool, &req->res.headers, H2O_TOKEN_CONTENT_TYPE, 
    NULL, H2O_STRLIT("text/plain"));    
  h2o_send_inline(req, H2O_STRLIT("Hello, world\n"));
  
  return 0;
}
```

Note that this uses `h2o_memis` to check it is getting a GET request, and if
it isn't, the handler returns -1 to indicate it did not handle the request.

We then set status, reason, content-type, and use the helper function
`h2o_send_inline` to send a response.

`h2o_send_inline` is a slower convenience function for sending chunks of
memory to a client. Behind this function hide `generators` which are a more
generic and faster way of sending data, without having to supply all data in
one go.

# Config, context, accept context
In this small sample, we've been passing around an H2O config, a context and
an accept context. 

**NOTE**: This section is quite speculative

## Global configuration
The global configuration actually is not global, as in, it is possible to
run several completely independent h2o instances within a single binary. It
is however also possible to have a single instance that serves on several
listening sockets and also offers multiple servers in there, and these then
share the 'global' configuration.

The global configuration knows specifies things like HTTP/1 or HTTP/2
timeouts, if HTTP/1 connections should attempt an upgrade to HTTP/2, maximum
size of POST data and many other settings. The defaults are good though.

## Accept context
A socket that listens can serve all or only some of the registered 'hosts'.
It can also have its own SSL/TLS settings. These details are stored in the
`h2o_accept_ctx_t`.

## Context
The context owns the event loop, to which multiple sockets can report, that
in turn can report to different accept contexts. 

It also keeps counters for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections.

# Generators
As noted above, `h2o_send_inline` is a convenience function for sending data
in response to an HTTP request. If we want to send a fixed blob of data we
already have in memory this is fine, but if we for example want to send the
large output of a SQL query, which arrives in separate rows, this is not the
best interface.

The 'long form' of sending data to a request is by setting a `generator`:

```
    h2o_generator_t generator = {proceedSending, stopSending};
    h2o_start_response(req, &generator);

    h2o_iovec_t buf;
    
    // gather initial data from SQL query, store it in buf
    
    h2o_send(req, &buf, 1, H2O_SEND_STATE_IN_PROGRESS);
```

First we register two callbacks: `proceedSending` and `stopSending`. The
last one is called when the HTTP session went away for any reason, and
offers us the ability to close down the SQL session or perform any other
cleanup.

We then gather some initial data and send that using `h2o_send`. In this
syntax we can pass an array of `h2o_iovec_t` buffers, but here we pass just
1. The final parameter `H2O_SEND_STATE_IN_PROGRESS` means that at a later
stage we might have more data to offer. 

Importantly, while `h2o_send` is working on the data, you must not touch or
free the data you passed to be sent: `libh2o` made no copy for you. This in
contrast to `h2o_send_inline` which as a convenience does so for you.

Once `libh2o` has sent out the initial data, it will call our
`proceedSending` callback to ask for more. That is also the moment we can
free any memory we allocated for `h2o_send`. If in `proceedSending` we find
that we've hit the end of the data we want to serve, we emit a final call to
`h2o_send` with as final parameter `H2O_SEND_STATE_FINAL`. 

We are not guaranteed to get a call to `stopSending`, so any cleanup should
be performed once we pass `H2O_SEND_STATE_FINAL`.

# Serving files
A special case is serving static files from disk. This can of course be
implemented using `h2o_start_response`, but `h2o` has built-in primitives to
make this happen:

```
    h2o_pathconf_t* pathconf = h2o_config_register_path(hostconf, "/", 0);
    h2o_file_register(pathconf, "examples/doc_root", NULL, NULL, 0);
```
The third parameter of `h2o_file_register` specifies an array of files that
could serve the index of that path. The fourth parameter is an optional map
of MIME-types. The final parameter specifies flags [XXX which ones?]

If it is known what files to serve exactly, `h2o_file_register_file` can be
used.

# Passing data to handlers

# SSL / TLS
`libh2o` uses OpenSSL or picotls for HTTPS and HTTPS/2. There is significant
interaction between the TLS and HTTP components. When using OpenSSL, we
first need to initialize that library:

**Question**: Is picotls standalone? Or does it get its crypto operations
from OpenSSL?

```
SSL_load_error_strings();
SSL_library_init();
OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
```

In `libh2o`, TLS is specific for an accept context as described above. Here
is how we hook op OpenSSL to the accept context:

```
accept_ctx.ssl_ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_server_method());
accept_ctx.expect_proxy_line = 0; // makes valgrind happy
```

We can then continue to configure OpenSSL with options:
```
SSL_CTX_set_options(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);
SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, 1);

/* load certificate and private key */
if(SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, cert_file) != 1) {
  fprintf(stderr, "an error occurred while trying to load server certificate file:%s\n", cert_file);
  return -1;
}

if(SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, key_file, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) != 1) {
  fprintf(stderr, "an error occurred while trying to load private key file:%s\n", key_file);
  return -1;
}

char ciphers[]="DEFAULT:!MD5:!DSS:!DES:!RC4:!RC2:!SEED:!IDEA:!NULL:!ADH:!EXP:!SRP:!PSK";
if(SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, ciphers) != 1) {
  fprintf(stderr, "ciphers could not be set: %s\n", ciphers);
  return -1;
}
```

Finally, we can hook up HTTP2 selection to 'NPN' and 'ALPN':

**Question**: Is this good? Should users do NPN and ALPN? What is the
difference?

```
/* setup protocol negotiation methods */ // I have no idea what this means
#if H2O_USE_NPN
  h2o_ssl_register_npn_protocols(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, h2o_http2_npn_protocols);
#endif
#if H2O_USE_ALPN
  h2o_ssl_register_alpn_protocols(accept_ctx.ssl_ctx, h2o_http2_alpn_protocols);
#endif
```

# HTTP/2 specific features

**Question**: How much of the pushed data smarts are in libh2o? How many are
in "h2o the server". Is this CASPER?

# Event loops (libuv, native)
**Question**: Is there any benefit to using libuv?  When would you want to
do that?
...
